Ever since a very young age, I ended up repairing phones, fixing and building computers, modding my video games, and getting an education and employment in IT. About 2 years ago I was experimenting with creating my own SNES game, and learned about coding. I bought some coding books, and applied to NSS, which would end up being one of the most enjoyable years of my life. The feeling I get from completing a project that I have poured all of my creativity, self-expression, and passion into is so rewarding. And that is my ongoing journey in the world of technology.",
